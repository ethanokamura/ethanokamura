Today, I talked to a staff engineer at uber eats. These were the main points:

### Job Postings:
- the job postings are made to weed out as many bad people as possible as fast as possible
- HR just gets parameters
- Apply if you think you can handle the job description

### Job Interviews:
- Ask for clarification!
- Good things to ask in a technical interview
	1. Do you want correct and functional code (like leetcode)
	2. Do you want pretty code with good architecture
	3. Do you want code done with speed

The main thing here is that if you write the worlds best code when they just want a fast solution or you write a fast solution when they want clean well done code you will likely fail the interview

### The Job Itself:
- Ask questions (but not too many)
- Learn to find a balance between asking for help and being self sufficient (finding the answer on your own)
- Most likely, the person assigning you the task could do it 10x faster even with their current work load, but its a good learning experience and / or they don't want to do it. BUT this means bugging them with pointless questions will make them wish they just did it themselves
- A good time to ask questions is when there is a deadline or pressure to get something finished. If you have a problem that will be solved faster and more efficient by asking, then do so.
- A bad time to ask questions is when there is no deadline or pressure to get it done. If this is the case, you should try to figure it out on your own.
- Invest a good amount of your time when starting out in figuring out how to find the information you need. (ie can you find it on google or do you need to read the company docs)

### General Advice:
1. Do not brand yourself (at least early in your career)
	- This means do not say you are a "frontend" or "backend" engineer. You want to be a sponge for information and knowledge. Labeling yourself with a specialty early on will limit you and can deter people from hiring you. Especially without the experience to back you up
2. Do not stick to one technology
	- The field is always changing and everything from frameworks, languages, or even hardware will change
	- Being good (even really good) at just one thing could hurt you long term
	- People want to see that you are willing to adapt

### My Takeaway:
1. I think its really common to be stumped and immediately ask questions to find the solution. Obviously, it can be uncomfortable to be in a situation where you do not know how to do something - especially in a new environment when you feel like you have something to prove - but I think that there is an immense amount of growth to be made by struggling by yourself and learning to overcome the barriers on your own.
2. There is the classic issue of becoming the jack of all trades but master of none, but I think this is a bad way to look at it. You can be the jack of all trades (languages and frameworks) and master of none as long as you have mastered the fundamentals of each. Someone who is familiar with a few frameworks (react, svelte, etc), but truly understands the fundamentals of javascript, will be much more successful than someone who is really good at react. (Maybe not if the job is specifically for a react dev, but in general)
3. As for the job interview stuff, I think those three questions to ask during the job interviews will be super helpful and show off that you have a deep understanding of technical skills and the ability to get the job done right. My dad always says "measure twice, cut once". Essentially (in this context), its better to ask more questions before you start rather than start and get confused.
